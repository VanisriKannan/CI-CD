# Continous Integration/ Continous Delivery (CI/CD)
## *Understanding of CI/CD*

Continuous integration and continuous delivery are agile DevOps tactics that play an imperative role within the success of development workflow. Continuous integration is an automation practice that supports developers by building, testing, and integrating code changes within a shared repository. CI is beneficial in its ability to minimise issues that arise in the merging process allowing for a more testable build of code. Similarly, continuous delivery is an automation practice that focuses on preparing the code for release to a production environment. CDâ€™s objective is to thoroughly test the build by obtaining changes, configuring, and tracking issues. 


## *Tools Used Within CI/CD & Why They Are Used*

There are a vast number CI/CD tools available, three popular examples include, Jenkins, Gitlab and Teamcity. Jenkins is a Java based open-source tool, that is widely used for its well-structured and easy to comprehend script. Jenkins works by creating a feedback system which detects changes, pulls the changes, and runs the new build that has been prepared, frequently notifying developers if the artifact is valid. GitLab is a web-based tool that manages different aspects of the development life cycle, allowing developers to trigger builds, run tests, and deploy code with each commit or push, with an added ability to review code. Gitlab is commonly used for its ability to offer stronger version control and code collaboration as it is an all-inclusive application decreasing the time required for maintaining. Teamcity is also a Java based, however it is a server by JetBrains which provides an advantageous integration with Jira to easily track issues and code coverage capabilities. Some beneficial aspects of Teamcity include its ability to detect hung builds, highlight builds for follow-up puproses and its use of two separate version control systems source codes for a single build.
